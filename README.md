# irreligio.us

An incremental game in which you start a cult and must grow it into the dominant world religion.

## Current State

It can be run and played through a not-very-pretty debugging interface. To make testing easier, default configuration is massively sped up from what the final game will use, and the relationships between resources have not been play-tested or balanced in any meaningful way.

## Build and Run

```
npm install
npm run build
firefox public/index.html
```
